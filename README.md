# Applying_Convolutions_to_3D_Medical_volume
Applying 2D, 2.5D and 3D convolutions to a medical volume using PyTorch

In this notebook I practice applying 2D, 2.5D and 3D convolutions to a medical volume using PyTorch. 
PyTorch offers the functionality of computing convolutions with arbitrary kernel sizes, and handles all the mechanics of striding and padding
